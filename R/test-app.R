#' Run tests for a Shiny application
#'
#' @param appDir Path to directory containing a Shiny app (e.g. `app.R`) or
#'   single interactive `.Rmd`.
#' @param testnames Test script(s) to run. The .R extension of the filename is
#'   optional. For example, `"mytest"` or `c("mytest", "mytest2.R")`.
#'   If `NULL` (the default), all scripts in the tests/ directory will be
#'   run.
#' @param quiet Should output be suppressed? This is useful for automated
#'   testing.
#' @param compareImages Should screenshots be compared? It can be useful to set
#'   this to `FALSE` when the expected results were taken on a different
#'   platform from the one currently being used to test the application.
#' @param interactive If there are any differences between current results and
#'   expected results, provide an interactive graphical viewer that shows the
#'   changes and allows the user to accept or reject the changes.
#' @param updateExpected Update snapshots in case of differences after testing.
#' @param suffix An optional suffix for the expected results directory. For
#'   example, if the suffix is `"mac"`, the expected directory would be
#'   `mytest-expected-mac`.
#'
#' @seealso [snapshotCompare()] and [snapshotUpdate()] if
#'   you want to compare or update snapshots after testing. In most cases, the
#'   user is prompted to do these tasks interactively, but there are also times
#'   where it is useful to call these functions from the console.
