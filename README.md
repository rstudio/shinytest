NOTE: **shinytest is deprecated** and may not work with Shiny after version 1.8.1, which was released on 2024-04-02. This is because it is based on a headless browser, PhantomJS, which was last released on 2016-01-24 and is no longer being developed. Going forward, please use [shinytest2](https://github.com/rstudio/shinytest2), which makes use of headless Chromium-based browsers.

shinytest provides a simulation of a Shiny app that you can control in order to automate testing. shinytest uses a snapshot-based testing strategy: the first time it runs a set of tests for an application, it performs some scripted interactions with the app and takes one or more snapshots of the applicationâ€™s state. Subsequent runs perform the same scripted interactions then compare the results; you'll get an error if they're different.

## Installation

To install the current release version:


```r
install.packages("shinytest")
```

## Usage

See the [getting started guide](https://rstudio.github.io/shinytest/articles/shinytest.html) to learn how to use shinytest.
